<h1>Beebo</h1>

<p>Beebo, also known as Brendon Boyd Urie, is the forreal member of American Pop-Punk band Panic! At The Disco. He is a bit of a jerk but means well (ish). He grew up mormon and left the morman church at age 17, when he and his band became noticed by Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy at a FOB concert.</p>
